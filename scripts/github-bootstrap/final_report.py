text=f'''# Guildboard bootstrap report

**Final status: {status}.** Repository, Project and roadmap audit: **{r['result']}**. The remaining automation credential requirement is described below. Guildboard itself has not been implemented or deployed; no application/production acceptance is claimed.

Audit time: {r['generated_at']}. Audit inspected repository head `{r['repository']['head']}`; subsequent artifact-only commits may carry this report. Counts below come from live GitHub readback, not failed requests or Markdown-only relationships.

## Repository

- URL: {r['repository']['url']}
- Owner: `{r['repository']['owner']}`
- Visibility: {r['repository']['visibility']}; default branch: `{r['repository']['default_branch']}`
- License: MIT for original work, subject to future dependency/asset licensing review.
- Topics: {', '.join('`'+t+'`' for t in r['repository']['topics'])}
- Initial commit: [{root_commit}](https://github.com/{repo}/commit/{root_commit}), {commit_info[0]} — {commit_info[1]}.
- Foundation includes module boundaries for Activity/API/bot/shared contracts/auth/canvas/collaboration, database/migrations, GoDaddy VPS, tests and documentation, plus functioning bootstrap/reconciliation/audit tools. Runtime module READMEs explicitly identify implementation as future work.
- Issues, Discussions and Actions enabled. Dependabot alerts/security updates, secret scanning, push protection and private vulnerability reporting enabled. Workflow tokens default to read-only; GitHub-owned/verified actions allowed. Main rules require reviewed CODEOWNER PRs and the actual `Validate roadmap` check; an explicit administrator bootstrap bypass is documented. No review was fabricated.

## GitHub Project

- URL: {p['url']}
- Owner: `{p['owner']['login']}`; Project number: {p['number']}; public: {p['public']}.
- Configuration copied from [Pick Your AI Project #1](https://github.com/orgs/Pick-Your-AI/projects/1), with draft copying disabled. Initial copy independently contained **zero items**. Source issues, PRs and assignments were not imported. The source Project was read-only.
- Repository association verified: `{repo}`.
- Default first view: Workstream overview, table grouped by Tier, native hierarchy and sub-issue progress visible.
- {len(p['views']['nodes'])} saved views, {len(p['fields']['nodes'])} total native/configuration fields, {sum(w['enabled'] for w in p['workflows']['nodes'])} enabled native workflows. Default Burn up Insight retained.

Every descendant is enrolled and fully classified. Native links, rather than body links, establish hierarchy and blockers. Verification tasks remain open and unverified.

All research investigations remain Unverified. Their 14 tracked evidence gaps are in [RISKS.md](RISKS.md); default Unverified values on non-research work are not counted as separate assumptions. Ready research is distinct from ready coding. Unassigned backlog remains visible and is not an integrity error.

## Verification and traceability

- Repository configuration and committed foundation: {r['result']}.
- Project owner, visibility, association, field schema, views/groupings/columns: {r['result']}.
- Native hierarchy and enrollment: {r['result']}; no accidental orphan descendants.
- Native dependency graph: {r['result']}; no self-dependencies or cycles.
- Strict initial triage/readiness/label/milestone checks: {r['result']}.
- Traceability: [307 authored capability clauses](TRACEABILITY.md), plus focused MVP integrated acceptance {link('GB-T12.MVP1')}; implementation, testing, documentation and release-gate links are recorded in [traceability.json](traceability.json).
- Critical-path report: [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md), based on the verified native graph. Longest chains are unweighted prerequisite sequences, not time forecasts.
- MVP approval consumes only M0–M2 prerequisite phases; no invented dates.
- Milestones: [MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md), nine milestones with no due dates.
- Machine readback: [remote-audit.json](audit/remote-audit.json).

Release gates: MVP {link('GB-T13.G1')}; production recovery/GoDaddy {link('GB-T13.G2')}; stable approval {link('GB-T13.G3')}. Actual publication is separate: MVP {link('GB-T13.04.01.O1')}, stable v1.0 {link('GB-T13.04.01.O2')}. These are future engineering work, not performed releases.
