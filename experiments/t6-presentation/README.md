# T6 presenter/follow experiment v0 — research only

Issue: [GB-T6.R1 / #196](https://github.com/CompleteTech-DiscordApps/guildboard/issues/196).
Evidence date: 2026-10-25. Base: `da811252acc975a0e5a1b087ab653b523443f3fa`.
This is **not product integration, an accepted architecture, or the blocked #197
specification**. It imports no runtime dependencies and does not implement T2
roles/grants, T4 transport or canvas rendering. #196 remains incomplete.

## Scope and live readiness evidence

Exact API reads on the evidence date: #196 full body, its comments (empty),
`issues/196/dependencies/blocked_by` (empty), parent #195 and consumer #197.
#196 explicitly permits independent research; #197 has one native blocker (#196).
The initial Ready field in the issue is not a claim that the live Project was
revalidated. No claim/assignment, Project, issue or PR was changed. Parent T6
consumes T2 write grants, T4 transport and T7 accessible shell controls. This
experiment consumes trusted policy decisions rather than choosing their contracts.

## Decision candidates and concrete counterexamples

1. **Presenter user + sequence only:** rejected by the executable Alice → revoked
   → Alice counterexample. An old Alice packet at seq 99 is still the same user
   and can overwrite a new seq 0 stream. Candidate: a board-scoped authority epoch
   advanced on every accepted control transition, plus monotone packet sequence.
2. **Presentation as a content-write mode:** not selected. Candidate: presentation
   is an orthogonal authority overlay on open/moderated/locked/request-to-draw.
   Follow and presenter status cannot produce write rights. T2 supplies the
   current mode-aware write decision; locked is an additional hard denial.
   The final mode/role/grant matrix belongs to #197 and T2, not this model.
3. **Save displayed viewport on every Follow click:** rejected by the second
   executable counterexample: clicking Follow twice overwrites personal navigation
   with the presenter's viewport. Candidate: keep personal and displayed state
   separate, make Follow idempotent, and restore personal view on Unfollow.
4. **Implicit follow after reconnect/change:** not selected in this experiment.
   Candidate: trusted snapshot clears follow, restores personal view and requires
   explicit rejoin. Mode transitions conservatively revoke presenter unless an
   explicit presenter is supplied atomically. Whether continuity is preferable,
   how grants/requests survive mode changes, and disconnect grace duration remain
   product/specification decisions; no guessed timers or grant lifecycle added.

These are recommendations for review, not accepted policy. Sequence-only can be
made safe with an independently scoped stream identifier: that is equivalent to
adding the missing lifetime fence, not evidence against epochs.

## Model boundary and results

`Authority` is trusted board-scoped current state. `control_allowed`,
`current_t2_write_allowed`, `session_valid`, and `scope_matches` are trusted
hypothetical server decisions, **not values accepted from a browser**. Likewise
`Packet.sender` represents authenticated session identity after identity binding,
not a client-asserted user field. Tests using Mallory exercise this identity
comparison, not OAuth/Discord authentication. `snapshot` receives a trusted
current authority snapshot, not an arbitrary untrusted wire object. No JSON
schema, socket, database transaction, membership resolution, or authorization
cache is implemented.

The publication gate checks current read/session eligibility and presenter scope,
identity and epoch. It does not track server sequence replay or rate limits;
receiver ordering prevents duplicate/old delivery from moving a following viewer.
A production protocol must bind sequence state to authenticated stream lifetime,
bound publication frequency, and invalidate sessions/tenant membership correctly.
Revocation becomes visible to the model receiver when a trusted snapshot arrives;
this does **not** prove immediate client-side revocation over a delayed network.
The server rejects newly submitted old-epoch events after its transition step.

Suggested viewport bounds for this experiment only: finite x/y ±1,000,000,
zoom 0.1–10, safe-integer sequence 0–2^53−1. Bool-as-number, NaN, infinity,
wrong board/guild, wrong presenter, stale epoch and invalid sequence are rejected
without state changes. Wire parsing and malicious object types are not modeled.

Reproduce from repository root (Python **3.12.14**, standard library only):

```sh
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s experiments/t6-presentation -v
python3 scripts/github-bootstrap/validate.py
git diff --check
```

Observed: **12 tests pass**, including all 64 combinations of four mode values,
trusted T2 allow/deny, session valid/invalid, scope match/mismatch and presenter
present/absent; 24 packet permutations replayed twice; both concurrent CAS control
orders; negative publication/control cases and the research counterexamples. Regression
cases additionally reject huge integers without float overflow and retain the
same-stream sequence watermark across reconnect (seq10 then delayed seq1).
A new epoch or board resets the watermark; an unchanged epoch does not. These are
bounded deterministic schedules, not exhaustive distributed-state verification.
Calls serialize atomically in memory; there is no claim about transaction locks,
multi-process behavior, fairness, persistence, liveness, or real network ordering.

## Primary sources and evaluated versions

- [Discord Activities overview](https://docs.discord.com/developers/activities/overview),
  live unversioned documentation retrieved 2026-10-25: Activities run in iframes on
  desktop, mobile and web. This motivates separate client validation; it supplies
  no Guildboard presenter protocol or permission guarantee. **No SDK version is
  evaluated** here, since no SDK is installed/executed.
- [Excalidraw props](https://docs.excalidraw.com/docs/@excalidraw/excalidraw/api/props/),
  live unversioned documentation retrieved 2026-10-25: exposes `viewModeEnabled`
  and `onScrollChange`. These are potential UI adapter surfaces, not a security
  boundary. **No Excalidraw package version is evaluated** here. The separate
  #98 pinned-library experiment remains the source for its own versioned evidence.
- Repository [T6 requirements](../../docs/workstreams/T6.md) and
  [initial architecture constraints](../../docs/architecture.md), evaluated at
  the base commit above: current policy and tenant scope must govern mutations.
  That document itself labels its architecture a proposal.

The only executable evaluated version is model **v0** on Python **3.12.14**.
No primary source is being represented as proving a candidate product choice.

## Acceptance mapping and remaining evidence

| #196 scope | Observable evidence | Still open |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Presenter authority / concurrent mode changes | CAS both orders; revoke/regrant ABA test; stale and forged identity tests | Reviewed T2/T4 contracts, server integration, disconnect policy |
| Follow / personal navigation | Idempotence, unfollow restore, navigation exits follow, explicit rejoin, scoped snapshot tests | Real canvas coordinate conversion and UI behavior |
| Across Discord clients | Primary source identifies desktop/web/mobile applicability | All actual desktop/web/mobile results; iframe/proxy behavior |
| Alternatives / versions / uncertainty | Counterexamples and source/version notes above | Functional, security and consumer review; accepted decision |

Required later real-client matrix: desktop, web and mobile, each with viewer and
writer, run designate/revoke/reassign presenter; follow, pan/zoom, unfollow and
rejoin; reconnect after mode change; late/duplicate delivery; cross-board switch.
Record exact SDK/editor/build/OS/client versions and dates. Check keyboard-only
controls, focus retention, screen-reader status announcements without cursor
noise, narrow layouts and reduced-motion behavior. None is tested by Python.
Do not retry the previously denied browser launch to manufacture this evidence.
GoDaddy Linux VPS HTTPS/WSS remains mandatory; infrastructure, proxy and load
claims are not applicable to this pure model and require later real-environment
verification. No credentials or production infrastructure are touched.

For #197 review: decide overlay versus mutually exclusive presentation mode,
mode/grant/queue lifecycle, disconnect/reconnect continuity, trusted snapshot
ordering, stream sequencing and rate bounds, viewport representation and
accessibility acceptance. Route functional review to Frontend & Canvas expertise,
security review to policy/identity expertise and integration review to T2/T4/T7
consumers. No actual human approval, merge, deployment or issue completion is
claimed by these artifacts.
