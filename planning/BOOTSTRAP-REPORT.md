# Guildboard bootstrap report

**Final status: Partially complete.** Repository, Project and roadmap audit: **pass**. The remaining automation credential requirement is described below. Guildboard itself has not been implemented or deployed; no application/production acceptance is claimed.

Audit time: 2026-10-24T03:56:38.837547+00:00. Audit inspected repository head `8d9ff061caffefe48056c2098b4bf35c8cc39b38`; subsequent artifact-only commits may carry this report. Counts below come from live GitHub readback, not failed requests or Markdown-only relationships.

## Repository

- URL: https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard
- Owner: `CompleteDotTech`
- Visibility: public; default branch: `main`
- License: MIT for original work, subject to future dependency/asset licensing review.
- Topics: `collaboration`, `discord`, `discord-activity`, `excalidraw`, `godaddy`, `moderation`, `open-source`, `react`, `realtime`, `self-hosted`, `typescript`, `websockets`, `whiteboard`
- Initial commit: [12254fa606aa59d6083ca241b5568958bfb9f626](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/commit/12254fa606aa59d6083ca241b5568958bfb9f626), 2026-10-23T22:39:33-04:00 — Establish Guildboard engineering foundation and canonical delivery roadmap.
- Foundation includes module boundaries for Activity/API/bot/shared contracts/auth/canvas/collaboration, database/migrations, GoDaddy VPS, tests and documentation, plus functioning bootstrap/reconciliation/audit tools. Runtime module READMEs explicitly identify implementation as future work.
- Issues, Discussions and Actions enabled. Dependabot alerts/security updates, secret scanning, push protection and private vulnerability reporting enabled. Workflow tokens default to read-only; GitHub-owned/verified actions allowed. Main rules require reviewed CODEOWNER PRs and the actual `Validate roadmap` check; an explicit administrator bootstrap bypass is documented. No review was fabricated.

## GitHub Project

- URL: https://github.com/users/CompleteDotTech/projects/7
- Owner: `CompleteDotTech`; Project number: 7; public: True.
- Configuration copied from [Pick Your AI Project #1](https://github.com/orgs/Pick-Your-AI/projects/1), with draft copying disabled. Initial copy independently contained **zero items**. Source issues, PRs and assignments were not imported. The source Project was read-only.
- Repository association verified: `CompleteDotTech/guildboard`.
- Default first view: Workstream overview, table grouped by Tier, native hierarchy and sub-issue progress visible.
- 17 saved views, 26 total native/configuration fields, 7 enabled native workflows. Default Burn up Insight retained.

Target Date is a DATE field and remains blank on all items; Blocking Reason is derived TEXT. Native Title, Assignees, Parent issue, Sub-issues progress, Labels, Milestone and Linked pull requests were reused without duplicates. Text cells have a 256-character limit, so blocker summaries show counts/issue numbers and a direct first-blocker link; native relationships and issue bodies retain every blocker.

### Native workflows

- Auto-add sub-issues to project: enabled.
- Auto-add to project: enabled.
- Auto-close issue: disabled.
- Item added to project: enabled.
- Item closed: enabled.
- Item reopened: enabled.
- Pull request linked to issue: enabled.
- Pull request merged: enabled.

New/reopened intake uses Triage; closed items use Done; linked PRs use In Progress; merged PR items use Done. Auto-close issue on Project Done is disabled. No automation marks implementation or research Verified. Closed/reopened/PR rules were inspected as saved native configuration; enrollment was validated using actual Guildboard items.

## Triage statistics

| Classification | Live count |
| --- | ---: |
| Priority: Critical | 286 |
| Priority: High | 182 |
| Priority: Medium | 0 |
| Priority: Low | 3 |
| Readiness: Ready | 17 |
| Ready-to-implement Task/Subtask items | 3 |
| Native-dependency Blocked | 272 |
| Readiness: Needs Research | 0 |
| Research investigations awaiting evidence | 14 |
| Intentionally unassigned | 471 |
| Missing/contradictory metadata issues | 0 |
| Verified implementation items | 0 |

All research investigations remain Unverified. Their 14 tracked evidence gaps are in [RISKS.md](RISKS.md); default Unverified values on non-research work are not counted as separate assumptions. Ready research is distinct from ready coding. Unassigned backlog remains visible and is not an integrity error.

## Verification and traceability

- Repository configuration and committed foundation: pass.
- Project owner, visibility, association, field schema, views/groupings/columns: pass.
- Native hierarchy and enrollment: pass; no accidental orphan descendants.
- Native dependency graph: pass; no self-dependencies or cycles.
- Strict initial triage/readiness/label/milestone checks: pass.
- Traceability: [307 authored capability clauses](TRACEABILITY.md), plus focused MVP integrated acceptance [GB-T12.MVP1](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/issues/455); implementation, testing, documentation and release-gate links are recorded in [traceability.json](traceability.json).
- Critical-path report: [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md), based on the verified native graph. Longest chains are unweighted prerequisite sequences, not time forecasts.
- MVP approval consumes only M0–M2 prerequisite phases; no invented dates.
- Milestones: [MILESTONES.md](MILESTONES.md), nine milestones with no due dates.
- Machine readback: [remote-audit.json](audit/remote-audit.json).

Release gates: MVP [GB-T13.G1](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/issues/456); production recovery/GoDaddy [GB-T13.G2](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/issues/457); stable approval [GB-T13.G3](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/issues/472). Actual publication is separate: MVP [GB-T13.04.01.O1](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/issues/471), stable v1.0 [GB-T13.04.01.O2](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/issues/473). These are future engineering work, not performed releases.

## CI and repeatability

- [Planning integrity](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/actions/runs/40060080436): success at `8d9ff061caffefe48056c2098b4bf35c8cc39b38`.
- [Remote roadmap integrity](https://github.com/CompleteDotTech/guildboard/actions/runs/40060102520): success at `8d9ff061caffefe48056c2098b4bf35c8cc39b38`.

Idempotent issue detection was rerun after population; no additional issues were created. Initial comments use durable markers and the live audit verifies exactly one per selected handoff. Scripts preserve assignments and legitimate established field changes; explicit reviewed plan flags were used for the bootstrap milestone/release refinements.

## Remaining or unsupported operations

- **Scheduled full Project-field auditing needs `GUILDBOARD_PROJECT_TOKEN`.** No repository secret is configured. User-owned Projects do not accept the repository installation token for these API operations. A dedicated supported read-Project credential must be added by an authorized maintainer. Daily restricted-token repository integrity checks, native Project workflows, and the full authenticated on-demand audit are implemented; the broader local OAuth credential was not copied into Actions.
- No Discord application, GoDaddy VPS, DNS/TLS endpoint, production deployment or application acceptance test was performed by this bootstrap. These remain explicitly scoped, unverified roadmap work rather than missing claims of completed setup.
- GitHub content creation temporarily hit its secondary limit; creation was paused and resumed under the same account/API. Final counts include only confirmed live resources. All recoverable API/configuration discrepancies were reconciled before this report.
